Prediction model and source code for chaperone proteins identification

For running the code, download or clone the repository. 
1- Open chaperone-Predictor.py
2- Change the filname in Line 272 of code (for seq_record in SeqIO.parse("./data/chaperone2980.fasta", "fasta"))
3- Make sure model.pkl and std_scale.pkl are present in model folder
4- Benchmark data is also provided in data folder, which can be used to test the predictor.
